			<h5>By Michael Cooper (a fan of u/poem_for_your_sprog)</h5>

				When Parth decided to explore,<br></br>
				And browse the Internet;<br></br>
				They dreamed of servers near and far,<br></br>
				To which they could connect.<br></br>
				<br></br>
				"For knowledge of CS", they spoke,<br></br>
				"I've always sought and yearned -<br></br>
				Now Python, Java, C++,<br></br>
				are here for me to learn!"<br></br>
				<br></br>
				So Parth obtained a URL,<br></br>
				They typed it in with pride.<br></br>
				But Parth received a 404.<br></br>
				And Parth's connection died.<br></br>
				<br></br>
				"It's hopeless - helpless!" they exclaimed,<br></br>
				"Whatever shall I do?"<br></br>
				They puzzled over what, pray tell,<br></br>
				Was driving them askew.<br></br>
				<br></br>
				Painstakingly, Parth checked their link,<br></br>
				Abrim with angst and pain.<br></br>
				They fixed the typo in their link.<br></br>
				And all was good again.<br></br>
