## Contents
[[TOC_NO_BULLET]]

This is an unofficial course information handout for CS 41 in Winter 2020. It is subject to change at any time before the course begins. Consider it a general overview of the logistics of the course.

## Course Overview

Welcome to Python! This 2-unit course will teach you the fundamentals and contemporary usage of Python, with a focus on developing best practices in writing Python and exploring the extensible and unique parts of the language.

## Instructors
ü¶Ñ Parth Sarin (psarin@stanford.edu)  
üêò Michael Cooper (coopermj@stanford.edu)

## Website
This is the course website: https://stanfordpython.com/

The course website has lots of useful resources, and it will be the primary reference for course content. There, you can find of the handouts, lecture slides, and additional resources. Bookmark the website and check it periodically to stay on top of announcements and course curriculum.

## Communication
You can reach Parth and Michael at the emails above, or you can email the entire course staff at staff@stanfordpython.com.

For questions specific to assignments or homework, please reach out to us via a Piazza post.

## Lectures
Lectures will be held Tuesday and Thursday, 2:30PM - 3:50PM PST on Zoom.

## Units
CS 41 is offered for 2 units on a Credit / No Credit basis. We expect this course to take 6-8 hours per week, including time you spend in lecture. There will be plenty of supplemental materials provided if you are interested in spending more time learning Python.

## Auditing
We welcome any and all auditors to CS 41. Please email us if you plan to audit this course, because we will need to make arrangements to accommodate the increased space requirements.

## Prerequisites
The formal prerequisite for the course is CS106B/X, but the underlying prerequisite is programming maturity. We will be reviewing Python from the ground up, so you will need to be comfortable with basic programming tools (control flow, data structures, functions, classes, modules, algorithms) in another language such as Java or C++.

## Office Hours
We will hold office hours during the week for you to ask questions and clarify material. If you are not available during our scheduled office hours, feel free to email us and we will try to schedule an outside appointment. Office hours time and location will be posted the first week of the quarter.

## Piazza
This quarter we will be using Piazza for class discussion. Rather than emailing us questions, we encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. Our class page is at https://piazza.com/stanford/spring2021/cs41/.

## Readings
There are no required readings for this course, but there will be optional reading materials posted on a week-by-week basis to supplement the course material for those who are very interested in Python. You will not be held responsible for any information presented only through optional readings; however, the material is fascinating and worth looking at.

## Assignments
There will be four assignments in this course. Each is expected to take fewer than eight hours to complete. Instructions to submit assignments are provided on the course website.

## Exams
There are no exams in this course!

## Grading
Each assignment will be assessed on both functionality and style, on a checkmark scale (as with other introductory computer science courses at Stanford). 

In order to receive credit for this course, you must average a check in both functionality and style over the course of the quarter. If you are in danger of receiving no credit for this course, we will inform you in a timely manner so that you have ample time to remedy the situation.

## Feedback
We will have optional feedback sessions that you can schedule outside of office hours for one-on-one attention and homework review. These sessions are a lot like IGs (from the CS106 courses), but are not mandatory, and are intended as an opportunity for you to receive targeted instruction.

## Late Days
You are granted two 24-hour late days this quarter. Deadlines for assignments are strict. In extenuating circumstances, instructors can grant additional extensions, but only if (1) you inform us of a reason at least 24 hours in advance of the assignment deadline and (2) the stated reason merits an extension, left to the discretion of the instructors.

If you turn in an assignment late without late days remaining, the penalties are as follows:
* Between 0 and 48 hours late: Functionality/style grades capped at a check.
* Between 48 and 72 hours late: Functionality/style grades capped at a check-minus.
* No assignments will be accepted more than 72 hours late.
	
It is in your best interest to submit assignments on time. This means that if you turn in an assignment that would have received a check-plus/check 13 hours after the deadline without using any late-days, your final grade for that assignment is a check/check.

## Disabilities
Students who need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC) located within the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). SDRC staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact the SDRC as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk, and their phone number is 650-723-1066.

## Honor Code
Adhere to the [Stanford Honor Code](https://cs.stanford.edu/degrees/ug/HonorCode.shtml). If you receive help from an outside resource (e.g. a staff member, students in your dorm, or the internet), give credit where it is due within the source of your program. Cite all sources. For individual assignments, write up your solution independently of others. We hope that there are no problems, but we will look into any potential cases. We reserve our right to use software tools to compare your submissions against those other students and against code snippets available on the internet.

If you are unsure about an Honor Code situation, email either of us for clarification.
