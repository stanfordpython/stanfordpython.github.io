# Lesson Plan: Python & the Web (Week 5)

[[TOC]]

## Pre-Section Preparation
Visit the [Ed Workspace](https://edstem.org/us/courses/20141/workspaces/pihihq14oVn7GT76m8uucoUfUrhbAlLi) and fork it to make a copy that you own. 

Also, add questions for your students to the [mid-quarter feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-UWQy_eoUH1oqeEdp-jRIknjOeQOwNyOVmibXip9hGw/edit). Remember that our students aren't necessarily trained in giving good feedback. For every question you ask, have a concrete sense of what you're going to change, based on the answers they might give. Use question types (numeric, multiple choice, text, etc.) to make sure you're getting responses that you can use.

## Community Building \[10 mins\]

Here are some ideas for community building activities:
* Ask everyone a Would You Rather question; there's a list in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SobifNwo_dPMA_dO78IUVUuyATwlqF9N?usp=sharing)
* Have people sign up to lead a community building activity each week by adding their name to a Google Doc; then, each week, they'll be in charge of doing some sort of icebreaker during the first 5 minutes of section or so
* Ask people to send you their favorite meme/video/song/picture/... and share during section
* Ask people to DM you a fun fact about themselves and then share the fun fact and have them guess whose it was.
* Ask people to share the last picture they took on their phone (that they're comfortable with) and share about it.
* Play a (short) game like <https://skribbl.io>!


## Concept Review \[5 mins\]
There aren't too many concepts to review this time. We started with a conceptual review of how the internet works—if you'd like to brush up on this, we essentially covered sections 2, 7, and 9 of [this whitepaper](http://www.theshulers.com/whitepapers/internet_whitepaper/index.html) about how the internet works. Then we talked about APIs, which probably won't be too confusing—they basically just allow you to build code that interacts with external applications, be that a database, an app, some code that another person made, etc.

## Reddit Wallscraper \[40 mins\]
The headline for this week's lesson is the "Reddit Wallscraper" which has student scrape a sub-reddit to download pretty wallpapers for their computer. If they're having trouble coming up with a final project, we've had students convert this into a final project in the past (but we strongly discourage that!). 

**Important note:** The code will not work on Ed (because Ed blocks requests), but students can download the file to their local machine (right click on the sidebar and click "Download").

## Project Work Time \[20 mins\]
Send everyone the following link: <https://forms.gle/RYPmGKHrNoDQ5WzJ7> (also linked on the website). By 5pm on Saturday, they should submit their proposal for their final project. All of the questions are optional, and the purpose is more for them than it is for us. We're just looking to give them feedback on their assignment, based on what is helpful for them!

## Mid-Quarter Feedback \[10 mins\]
For the last ten minutes of class, have students fill out the Mid-Quarter feedback form: <https://forms.gle/ddj6yr8yH23W72mD9> (also linked on the website).


## Weekly Reflection

This week's two-person conversation is between **Theo and Elizabeth**. Discuss how the quarter has been going so far, challenges you're facing in your section, and report back with ideas!

For everyone, please send a message in the TA group chat before Monday responding to the following:
> We've talked about how feedback should be student-centered. Hopefully you have a rough sense of the individual goals that your students have for taking this class. What are they?
