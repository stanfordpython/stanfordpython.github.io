# Lesson Plan: Python Standard Libraries (Week 8)

Hi everyone!

For section this week we have two agenda items. This section will be more chill because its your last section and we expect lower attendence given its week 9. 

## Community Building \[5 mins\]

Reflect with your section on your favorite projects/concepts from the quarter!


## Python Passion \[30 mins\]

For the first 30 mins, we want YOU (the TA) to share one of your python passions. Share a library, project, or aspect of python that draws you to the langauage and gets you exctied about programming. Don't stress to much preparing for this, we just want you to be able to show your passion for python.

If you need help getting ideas for this, refer to this list below of cool python ideas. I focused on gaming for the last lecture, but feel free to expand on anythign that interests you!
