# Discussion Norms

### Engage
* Take space when it's your turn to speak, then step down and make space for others.
* Be willing to talk and engageâ€”especially with your team and your peers.
* Be open to being wrong and being challenged.
* No cold-calling.
* The course staff should strive to allow everyone to participate in the discussion so that it isn't monopolized.

### Have empathy
* Don't judge people for asking questions and respect their ideas.
* Be conscious of different experiences and backgrounds in CS and life more generally.
* When being critical, make sure to be respectful.

### In groups
* Everyone should introduce themselves with their name and pronouns (if comfortable) first.
* Group members should check in on each other at the beginning of meetings.

### Logistical
* Use Ed to ask and answer questions of each other and of the course staff.
* Maintain open, honest, and frequent communication between students and staff.

### Take breaks
* Have breaks or low-energy transitions between topics.
