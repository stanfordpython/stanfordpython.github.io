            <p class="blurb">I make an effort to archive each quarter's offering of CS41 for those who are interested, but this page is not actively maintained. If you encounter any missing or broken links along the way, please let me know!</p>
            <p class="blurb">You can use these resources to read through old course materials from previous quarters, or just chart the evolution of the class. It's actually quite cool to see the trajectory of CS41!</p>
            <p class="blurb">If you are a student currently enrolled in the course, it is an honor code violation to look at solutions to assignments from previous quarters (although you are free to look at the assignments, lectures, labs, etc).</p>
            <p class="bl">Note: we removed /words as a top-level resource (it was only used in autumn 2015)</p>
