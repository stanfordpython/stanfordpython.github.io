We briefly look at a few looping techniques (enumerate, zip), and then dive into comprehensions. Python allows us to write list, dictionary, and set comprehensions, and we'll explore these tools as well as their connection to higher-level reasoning about problem-solving."

We'll understand iterators, generator expressions, and generators as core ideas in functional programming, and briefly talk about where these tools could show up in Python. Lastly, we'll go over decorators - an amazing application of functional programming ideas to solve common programming problems."

Closure semantics are also reviewed as a preview for the main event - writing decorators!"
