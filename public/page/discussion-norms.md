# Discussion Norms

1. ***Have empathy***
    * Don't judge people for asking questions and respect their ideas.
    * Be conscious of the absurd amount of stress that we're all under.
    * Be conscious of different experiences and backgrounds in CS and life more generally.
2. ***Zoom logistics***
    * Having your video on is encouraged but not required.
    * We'll try to use breakout rooms to build community and invite participation.
    * Use the chat to talk asynchronously, raise your hand to speak (one mic - step up and step down).
