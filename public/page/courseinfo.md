[[TOC_NO_BULLET]]

This is the course information handout for CS 41 in Spring 2021. We'll try not to change this too much but consider it a general overview of the logistics of the course.

## Course Overview

Welcome to Python! This 2-unit course will teach you the fundamentals and contemporary usage of Python, with a focus on applying best practices in writing Python and building meaningful projects under the supervision of the course staff.

## Instructors
ü¶Ñ Parth Sarin (psarin@stanford.edu)  
üêò Michael Cooper (coopermj@stanford.edu)

[Email Parth and Michael](mailto:psarin@stanford.edu,coopermj@stanford.edu)

## Website
This is the course website: <https://stanfordpython.com/>.

The course website has lots of useful resources, and it will be the primary reference for course content. There, you can find of the handouts, lecture slides, and additional resources. Bookmark the website and check it periodically to stay on top of announcements and course curriculum.

## Communication
You can reach Parth and Michael at the email link above, or you can get in touch with your TA however they prefer once we've started with discussion sections.

For questions specific to assignments or homework, please reach out to us via Ed.

## Lectures
Lectures will be held Tuesday and Thursday, 2:30PM - 3:50PM PST on Zoom.

## Units
CS 41 is offered for 2 units on a Credit / No Credit basis. We expect this course to take 6-8 hours per week, including time you spend in lecture. There will be plenty of supplemental materials provided if you are interested in spending more time learning Python.

## Auditing
We welcome any and all auditors to CS 41. Please email us if you plan to audit this course so we can share the Zoom link with you to audit live.

## Prerequisites
The formal prerequisite for the course is CS106B/X, but the "real" prerequisite is programming maturity. We will be reviewing Python from the ground up, so you will need to be comfortable with basic programming tools (control flow, data structures, functions, classes, modules, algorithms) in another language such as Java or C++.

## Office Hours
We will hold office hours during the week for you to ask questions and clarify material. If you are not available during our scheduled office hours, feel free to email us and we will try to schedule an outside appointment. Office hours time and location will be posted the first week of the quarter.

## Ed
This quarter we will be using Ed for class discussion. Rather than emailing us questions, we encourage you to post your questions on Ed so everyone can see. Our class page is at <https://edstem.org/us/courses/2850/>.

## Assignments
There will be four assignments in this course. Each is expected to take fewer than eight hours to complete. Instructions to submit assignments are provided on the course website.

## Exams
There are no exams in this course!

## Grading
Each assignment will be assessed on both functionality and style, on a checkmark scale (as with other introductory computer science courses at Stanford). 

In order to receive credit for this course, you must average a check in both functionality and style over the course of the quarter. If you are in danger of receiving no credit for this course, we will inform you in a timely manner so that you have ample time to remedy the situation.

## Feedback
We will have optional feedback sessions that you can schedule outside of office hours for one-on-one attention and homework review. These sessions are a lot like IGs (from the CS106 courses), but they aren't required‚Äîthey're just intended to be an extra resource for you.

## Late Days
In our view, assignments are one (imperfect) way to get a sense of how much you're learning in the course. We care far more about the learning than the assignments. As such, we try to be lenient with our extension policy‚Äîreach out to your TA or the instructors if you need extra time with an assignment or are encountering significant roadblocks. We'll work together to find a good timeline for the assignment or an alternate way to demonstrate learning.

With that disclaimer, you are also granted two 24-hour late days that you can use for any reason. Using a late day allows you to turn in an assignment 24 hours later than the original deadline with no penalty. There's no need to let us know you're using a late day; if you turn in an assignment late we'll assume you're using late days (unless you reach out to us indicating otherwise).

If you turn in an assignment late without late days remaining, the penalties are as follows:
* Between 0 and 48 hours late: Functionality/style grades capped at a check (‚úì).
* Between 48 and 72 hours late: Functionality/style grades capped at a check-minus (‚úì-).
* No assignments will be accepted more than 72 hours late.

## Disabilities
Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty. Unless the student has a temporary disability, Accommodation letters are issued for the entire academic year. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 650-723-1066, URL: <https://oae.stanford.edu/>).

## Honor Code
Adhere to the [Stanford Honor Code](https://cs.stanford.edu/degrees/ug/HonorCode.shtml). If you receive help from an outside resource (e.g. a staff member, students in your dorm, or the internet), give credit where it is due within the source of your program. Cite all sources. For individual assignments, write up your solution independently of others. We hope that there are no problems, but we will look into any potential cases. We reserve our right to use software tools to compare your submissions against those other students and against code snippets available on the internet.

If you are unsure about an Honor Code situation, email either of us for clarification.
