# Lesson Plan: Python & the Web, APIs (Week 4)

## Pre-Section Preparation
Visit the [Ed Workspace](https://edstem.org/us/courses/38060/workspaces/pBfxWc66Ji4c8sq70xiNCQnGZ5YxoTDg) and fork it to make a copy that you own. 

## Community Building \[10 mins\]

Here are some ideas for community building activities:
* Ask everyone a Would You Rather question; there's a list in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SobifNwo_dPMA_dO78IUVUuyATwlqF9N?usp=sharing)
* Have people sign up to lead a community building activity each week by adding their name to a Google Doc; then, each week, they'll be in charge of doing some sort of icebreaker during the first 5 minutes of section or so
* Ask people to send you their favorite meme/video/song/picture/... and share during section
* Ask people to DM you a fun fact about themselves and then share the fun fact and have them guess whose it was.
* Ask people to share the last picture they took on their phone (that they're comfortable with) and share about it.


## Concept Review \[10 mins\]
There aren't too many concepts to review this time. We started with a conceptual review of how the internet works—if you'd like to brush up on this, we essentially covered sections 2, 7, and 9 of [this whitepaper](http://www.theshulers.com/whitepapers/internet_whitepaper/index.html) about how the internet works. Then we talked about APIs, which probably won't be too confusing—they basically just allow you to build code that interacts with external applications, be that a database, an app, some code that another person made, etc.

## Reddit Wallscraper \[50 mins\]
The headline for this week's lesson is the "Reddit Wallscraper" which has student scrape a sub-reddit to download pretty wallpapers for their computer. If they're having trouble coming up with a final project, we've had students convert this into a final project in the past (but we strongly discourage that!). 

**Important note:** The code will not work on Ed (because Ed blocks requests), but students can download the file to their local machine (right click on the sidebar and click "Download").

## Group Work \[20 min\]
The new assignment (`augment.py`) has just been released, so you might want to spend some time talking about it or giving students the option to work on it together.
