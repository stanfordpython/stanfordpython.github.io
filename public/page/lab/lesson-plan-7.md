# Lesson Plan: Functional Programming (Week 7)

## Pre-Section Preparation
Visit the [Ed Workspace](https://edstem.org/us/courses/20141/workspaces/pZj6H9a0FcnQruIvSbvvd7I3S3KgwBYu) and fork it to create your own copy.

## Community Building \[5 mins\]

Here are some ideas for community building activities (mostly these are the same as last week, with the top one being a new addition):
* Ask everyone a Would You Rather question; there's a list in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SobifNwo_dPMA_dO78IUVUuyATwlqF9N?usp=sharing)
* Have people sign up to lead a community building activity each week by adding their name to a Google Doc; then, each week, they'll be in charge of doing some sort of icebreaker during the first 5 minutes of section or so
* Ask people to send you their favorite meme/video/song/picture/... and share during section.
* Ask people to DM you a fun fact about themselves and then share the fun facts; have them guess whose it was.
* Ask people to share the last picture they took on their phone (that they're comfortable with) and share about it.
* Play a (short) game like skribbl.io!
* Build a trivia quiz (maybe from the trivia API?) and see if your students can figure it out.
* Show and tell: ask everyone to get an object from their room that represents how they're feeling right now and share with the class.

## Concept Review \[20 mins\]

I've allocated 20 minutes for concept review this time because there's a lot more that people may be unfamiliar with this time around.

### Iterators
An iterator is...a thing that can be iterated over. It's kind of uninteresting on its own, but the idea is that when Python loops over, say, a list, it first builds an *iterator* from the list and loops over that. Once the iterator is complete, it raises `StopIteration` to signal that it's out of items.

```python
l = [1, 2, 3]

i = iter(l)

next(i) # => 1
next(i) # => 2
next(i) # => 3
next(i) # => StopIteration
```

Thus, the construction `for x in iterable` works like

```python
i = iter(iterable)
while True:
    try:
        x = next(i)
    except StopIteration:
        break
    
    do_something_to(x)
```

You can build custom objects that can be iterated over by implementing the `__iter__` method as a generator (see below).

### Generators
Generator functions are ways of creating iterables through the Python function construction. The paradigm is that you build a function which `yield`s values while it's executing; Python converts that into a generator. The function doesn't have to loop infinitely, but infinite sequences are a compelling reason to create a generator.

```python
def fibbi():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        a, b = b, a + b
        yield a

g = fibbi()

next(g) # => 1
next(g) # => 1
next(g) # => 2
next(g) # => 3
next(g) # => 5
next(g) # => 8
```

This generator continues forever but you can create a finite generator by `return`ing at some point during the function's execution. You can also create a generator comprehension which lazily executes using parenthesis:

```python
# doesn't compute the value for the entire range immediately:
g = (i ** 2 for i in range(10_000_000_000))

next(g) # => 0
next(g) # => 1
next(g) # => 4
next(g) # => 9
next(g) # => 16
```

This can be useful for doing things like membership checking. For example, you might check if `desired_value in (expensive_operation(elem) for elem in collection)`.

Generators are especially useful to represent

1. Arbitrarily large collections of data
2. Streams of data where the current state of the data is important in determining the next state of the data (i.e. you need to frequently "pause" the function in the middle of execution)

### Functions as Objects
This shouldn't be too confusing, but we used it as a way to segue into the idea of decorators. Briefly: because functions are objects, you can pass them into functions as parameters and return them from functions.

### Decorators
Decorators are functions which do both of the things aboveâ€”they take a function as a parameter and they return a function as output. In this way, they can take a function, "dress it up" (modify it), and then return the modified function. For example, this decorator returns a new function which behaves the same as the original function except prints out the time that it took to execute:

```python
from time import time

def timeit(fn):
    def timed(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time()
        out = fn(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time()

        print(f"Took {end - start:.2f} seconds.")
        return out
    
    return timed
```

Notice that the inner function, `timed`, has a generic signature. That's so it'll support any `fn` as input. Note also that we return `out` from the inner function and `timed` from the outer function. That way, it can be used like this:

```python
def fibbi(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

timed_fibbi = timeit(fibbi)
```

Because we returned `timed` from the inner function, `timed_fibbi` is in fact a function and references the original `fibbi` function in its implementation. If we wanted to, we could even have written `fibbi = timeit(fibbi)`, overwriting the value of `fibbi` in the global namespace. Python offers a different syntax for this, as well:

```python
@timeit
def fibbi(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```

The `@timeit` syntax will automatically replace `fibbi` with `timeit(fibbi)`.

### Map, Filter
Map and filter are functional replacements for comprehensions. They return generators instead of evaluating the `map` or `filter` function all at once.

Other than that, these two are analogous:

```python
[fn(x) for x in collection]
map(fn, collection)
```

and these two are analogous

```python
[x for x in collection if condition(x)]
filter(condition, collection)
```

You might prefer `map` and `filter` over the comprehension if the `collection` is very large (or infinite) or if the `fn` and `condition` are expensive or you don't want them computed on teh entire collection all at once.

### Lambda
Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions that are usually immediately passed to other functions. The syntax is `lambda [params]: [output value]`. For example:

```python
filter(lambda x: x.isnumeric(), lst)
```

## Problems \[50 mins\]

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span>I'd suggest that for the first two sections, you pick which problems you'd like your students to do. Doing all of them or leaving students to go through them without more guidance is probably a bad idea</span>
</div>

### Decorators

These decorators can get quite tricky. **`timeit`** is the most straightforward as it's something we've done before but haven't written as a decorator. I've seen **LRU Cache** before as an example interview problem, and it's definitely a practical problem, but you might want to walk through this with your section if that's the route you decide to take. **Better Debugging** can be complex or simple, depending on what your students want to go for. At its most complex, you can call `inspect.signature(fn).bind(*args, **kwargs)` to get the binding of arguments to the names of those arguments in the signature of `fn` which is quite cool!

### Generators

I'd suggest you pick one or two of these. If you pick **Inorder Tree Traversal**, I'd suggest doing **Iterating over Classes with Magic Methods** at the end because that problem is essentially the same as the tree traversal problem but implemented as `__init__` on the class instead.

Of these, I'm a huge fan of **Cartesian Product**. It's fun and applied and you can use it to introduce the recursive subtlety here. Ideally you'd probably want to do this:

```python
for var1 in lst1:
    for var2 in lst2:
        ...
            for varn in lstn:
                yield (var1, var2, ..., varn)
```

However, because you can't nest an arbitrary number of `for` loops, you have to use recursion. This becomes a really cool example of why functions-within-functions are useful and how we can build internally recursive generators. I'd highly recommend it, but it does take time.

If you're looking for something faster and easier, **Triangle Generator** is a cute and straightforward problem.

### Linear Algebra (Challenge)

This section is only accessible to folks who know linear algebra, but if they do, it's really cool. I'd suggest you familiarize yourself with the solution and let students who want to explore this on their own do so.

### Infinite Streams

I was struggling a lot to think about infinite streams of data, but it turns out there are a lot of good examples in the EE context. If students find that interesting, this is a very neat example of how you might build a generator in Python to determine when something is zero-crossing. You can also mention that - even though we didn't talk about this - a similar concept might be applied in more general signal analysis or other situations where we want to process a signal element by element (genome sequencing, etc.).

The Pythonic value of this stuff is...less interesting, but I wanted to include at least one of these problems.

### Lambda, Map, Filter, and Reduce

All of these problems are "busy work." None of them build on each other, and they're all just drills to make sure you know the material. I'd recommend spending a little bit of time here and moving on if your students know it or spending more time if they're struggling.

### Iterators

Here we dive into some of the weirdness of iterators (namely that they get consumed as they're used up). This concept is important for students to grasp, so if you get here, you should definitely talk about that. After mentioning that, I'd recommend you just explore `itertools` unless you did the tree traversal problem from earlier, in which case the magic methods section will be more rewarding.
