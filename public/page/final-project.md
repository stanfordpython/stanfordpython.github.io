# Final Project
**Due: Midnight, Friday, June 4, 2021**

## Rubric
Your final project grade will be assessed according to this rubric:

| Points | Category      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 25     | Breadth       | Does your project engage with multiple different concepts from lecture?                                                                                                  |
| 25     | Depth         | Does your project go beyond the concepts covered in lecture to investigate one or more Python features?                                                                  |
| 20     | Accessibility | Have you considered the accessibility concerns of your final project and taken steps to make the project accessible? Have you followed our guidance about accessibility? |
| 30     | Participation | Did you substantially contribute to the project?                                                                                                                         |

The first three categories of the rubric will be applied to your entire group and the last category will be assessed individually. Scores of 70 or below will receive a ✓-. Scores between 70 and 85 will receive a ✓. Scores of 85 or above will receive a ✓+.

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span>To pass the course, you need to average a ✓ on your assignments. If you're at all concerned about your standing in the course, please reach out to us. Note, by the way, that A2 was graded based on completion—there were three steps in each path: if you completed one, you received a ✓-, two steps received a ✓, and if you completed the entire assignment, you received a ✓+.</span>

## Deliverables
In addition to submitting your code (and everything that goes with it), you must include a `README.md` file as a meaningful writeup of your final project.

This writeup should contain a technical overview of the project and the code therein. In effect, you're writing documentation for your project - if the first thing someone reads about your project is the README, what information does she need to know? We're asking you to also include a technical section in your README to describe the code design, the purpose of various modules, and any requirements (e.g. must run a certain version of Python, or must have a particular operating system, or must have a Postgres database running, or must have a Google account, or anything else).

In addition, we're asking you to write short installation/execution instructions. After we download your code, what steps do we have to perform to get it up and running? For many projects, the answer will just be "run the main python script named `something.py`," but several others will have more complex configuration. If we can't set up your project, we have no way to confirm that your project works, so we hope that your installation instructions are clear, correct, replicable, and concise.

Other general sections of a README usually include, but are not limited to: known bugs, contact information for the maintainer (that's you!), and credits/acknowledgements.

There is no upper or lower limit to the length of the README. We've had successful README's in the past that are as short as a few hundred words, or some much longer, with the longest being around 2000 words. Regardless, the majority of the writeup should focus on the technical overview. You're free to write fewer or more words as you see fit, but remember that we are reading your README to understand what your project does.

## Submitting

Upload all of the files you want to submit, including a README and a short demo video, to [Paperless](https://cs198.stanford.edu/paperless/CS/41/assignments/677).

**WARNING: If you use any third-party libraries, ensure that you have generated a requirements.txt file listing your project's dependencies before submitting. You can do this by putting the output of `$ pip freeze` into a file. When exercising your code, we guarantee that we will run `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` to install this list of dependencies.**

If your project is sufficiently convoluted, make sure to add the corresponding clarifying information in your README file.

We highly recommend that you check your submission folder on Paperless after submitting to ensure that all necessary files were copied over successfully.
