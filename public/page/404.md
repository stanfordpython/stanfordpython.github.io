# 404
> By Michael Cooper (a fan of u/poem_for_your_sprog)

```
When Parth decided to explore,
And browse the Internet;
They dreamed of servers near and far,
To which they could connect.

"For knowledge of CS", they spoke,
"I've always sought and yearned -
Now Python, Java, C++,
are here for me to learn!"

So Parth obtained a URL,
They typed it in with pride.
But Parth received a 404.
And Parth's connection died.

"It's hopeless - helpless!" they exclaimed,
"Whatever shall I do?"
They puzzled over what, pray tell,
Was driving them askew.

Painstakingly, Parth checked their link,
Abrim with angst and pain.
They fixed the typo in their link.
And all was good again.
