## Overview
In Tuesday's lecture, we witnessed the shocking kidnapping of Unicornelius, our much-beloved CS 41 course mascot. Fortunately, the kidnapper left some clues as to Unicornelius' whereabouts - using your knowledge of Python, can you help solve the clues and locate our missing friend?

## Assignment Description

In this assignment, you will work with your project teams to help Pop Tart find Unicornelius.

The assignment will consist of the following components.

### Individual Pre-Quiz

To help us evaluate this assignment for use in future offerings of CS 41, we've implemented a short pre-quiz and post-quiz for this assignment. The pre-quiz is not a graded component of the course, but please do give it your best effort, as it will give us important data as we work to continue improving this assignment for future offerings of CS 41.

Once everyone in your project group has completed the pre-quiz, you will receive a _Group ID_, a numeric identifier which your group will use to sign into the subsequent stages of this assignment.

### Paths to Unicornelius

This assignment consists of two paths which you can take to find Unicornelius. You and your team are free to choose which path you undertake. The paths are of roughly equal length and difficulty, so there's no a priori reason to choose one path over the other: we've implemented this design to give you some additional choice in how you go about completing the quest. (For example, if you start on Path 1, and aren't enjoying the first part, you can easily double back and pursue Path 2).

We aren't going to reveal much more about the paths, though, as - much like a real quest - surprises will await you every step of the way!

### Individual Post-Quiz

After completing the assignment, you will be asked to complete an individual post-quiz, so that we can assess how well the assignment met its learning objectives. Much like the pre-quiz, this quiz will not be graded, but it will provide us with valuable data in improving this assignment for future offerings of CS 41.

This assignment wouldn't have been possible without so much support from our wonderful TAs: Antonio Ferriss, Elizabeth Fitzgerald, and Jose Francisco were instrumental in designing and implementing much of the core infrastructure of this assignment.

This assignment was partially inspired by Sam Redmond's "Quest for the Holy Grail" assignment, featured in previous offerings of CS 41.
