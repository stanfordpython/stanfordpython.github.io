# CS 41 Syllabus

## Contents
[[TOC]]

This is the course information handout for CS 41 in Spring 2022. We'll try not to change this too much but consider it a general overview of the logistics of the course.

## Course Overview

Welcome to Python! This 2-unit course will teach you the fundamentals, implementation details, and modern usage of Python, with a focus on applying best practices in writing Python and building projects under the supervision of the course staff.

## Learning Goals

After CS 41, students will be able to‚Ä¶

1. Compare and contrast Python‚Äôs language design with other languages they‚Äôve seen before.
2. Determine whether or not Python is an appropriate language to write a program in.
3. Implement a significant project in Python.
4. Translate code written in other languages into Python, especially code that doesn‚Äôt rely on third-party libraries.
5. Select the appropriate data structure for a program written in Python. Recognize when Python does not have the appropriate built-in data structure for a problem.
6. Design and implement custom Python objects (classes) for Python programs to augment Python‚Äôs object functionalities.
7. Interact with external applications, like web APIs, using Python to send requests and process responses.
8. Apply standard libraries and third-party packages to domain-relevant problems.

## Website
This is the course website: <https://stanfordpython.com/>.

The course website has lots of useful resources, and it will be the primary reference for course content. There, you can find of the handouts, lecture slides, and additional resources. Bookmark the website and check it periodically to stay on top of announcements and course curriculum.

## Communication
You can reach Parth and Tara at the email link above, or you can get in touch with your TA however they prefer once we've started with discussion sections. For questions specific to assignments or homework, please reach out to us via Ed.

## Lectures
Lectures will be held Tuesday and Thursday, 3:15 PM - 4:45 PM in McMurtry 350.

## Units
CS 41 is offered for 2 units on a Credit / No Credit basis. We expect this course to take 6-8 hours per week, including time you spend in lecture. There will be plenty of supplemental materials provided if you are interested in spending more time learning Python.

## COVID-19 Accommodations
This is a stressful time for everyone: students, TAs, and instructors. We've modified the curriculum quite a bit to be accommodating to the intense, undue burdens that we're all feeling right now. Here's a list of some of the ways we've changed the course:
* We've Marie Kondo'd the curriculum, keeping only what brings us joy
* We've extended the deadlines for many assignments
* We've changed the grading policy for assignments to focus more on feedback
* We're focusing more on group work this quarter‚Äîhopefully this will help enhance your work product while also lightening everyone's workload
* We've incorporated much more student voice in the curriculum‚Äîa lot more of the course is in your control
* We've designed a much more generous late day policy

We're very open to incorporating additional accommodations; just let us know what you need!

## Prerequisites
The formal prerequisite for the course is CS106B/X, but the "real" prerequisite is programming maturity. We will be reviewing Python from the ground up, so you will need to be comfortable with basic programming tools (control flow, data structures, functions, classes, modules, algorithms) in another language such as Java or C++.

## Office Hours
We will hold office hours by appointment. During the first week, we'll post a link that allows you to sign up for office hours when you need them.

## Ed
This quarter we will be using Ed for class discussion. Rather than emailing us questions, we encourage you to post your questions on Ed so everyone can see. Our class page is at <https://edstem.org/us/courses/20141/>.

## Assignments
There will be four assignments in this course. Each is expected to take fewer than eight hours to complete. Instructions to submit assignments are provided on the course website. There are no exams in this course!

In our view, assignments are one (imperfect) way to get a sense of how much you're learning in the course. We care far more about the learning than the assignments. As such, we try to be lenient with our extension policy‚Äîreach out to your TA or the instructors if you need extra time with an assignment or are encountering significant roadblocks. We'll work together to find a good timeline for the assignment or an alternate way to demonstrate learning.

## Feedback and Grading
We prioritize providing feedback, rather than grades. As such, many of our assignments won't be assigned a grade at all. The final project will be evaluated as to whether it meets expectations or not.

In order to receive credit for this course, you must meet expectations on the final project and Assignment 2. If you are in danger of receiving no credit for this course, we will inform you in a timely manner so that you have ample time to remedy the situation.

## Access and Accommodations
Stanford is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for disabled students. Disabled students are a valued and essential part of the Stanford community. We welcome you to our class.

If you experience disability, please register with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate your needs, support appropriate and reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Academic Accommodation Letter for faculty. To get started, or to re-initiate services, please visit¬†<https://oae.stanford.edu>.

If you already have an Academic Accommodation Letter, we invite you to share your letter with us. Academic Accommodation Letters should be shared at the earliest possible opportunity so we may partner with you and OAE to identify any barriers to access and inclusion that might be encountered in your experience of this course.

## Honor Code
Adhere to the [Stanford Honor Code](https://cs.stanford.edu/degrees/ug/HonorCode.shtml). If you receive help from an outside resource (e.g. a staff member, students in your dorm, or the internet), give credit where it is due within the source of your program. Cite all sources. For individual assignments, write up your solution independently of others. We hope that there are no problems, but we will look into any potential cases. We reserve our right to use software tools to compare your submissions against those other students and against code snippets available on the internet.

If you are unsure about an Honor Code situation, email either of us for clarification.
