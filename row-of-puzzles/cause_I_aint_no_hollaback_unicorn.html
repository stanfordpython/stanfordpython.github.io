            <h2>Anagram Puzzle</h2>
            <p>Help! Parth had written a bunch of words for you that nicely spelled out the next clue but then Michael came and shuffled them all out of order. Can you put them together correctly?</p>
            <p><i>Note: You could use Python to solve this, but you don't have to! Have fun with this!</i> If you want to use Python, there's a list of all the words in the English language at our website, <a href="https://stanfordpython.com/res/misc/words">https://stanfordpython.com/res/misc/words</a>.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Each line below is a word that's been shuffled out of order. Put the words back in order and then look at the <i>first character of each word</i>. Add <code>.json</code> to that and that'll be the location of the next puzzle.</p>
            <pre><code>
                ntovesir
                legrovvni
                olifayilfc
                uuernrt
                ptmesreinirt
                nnersayivar
                onobkote
            </code></pre>

            <p>For example, if the words, unshuffled, were:
            <pre><code>
                apple
                banana
                carrot
                donut
                egg
                fig
                grapefruit
                honey
            </code></pre>
            then your next puzzle would be located at <code>abcdefgh.json</code> (well, actually <code>https://stanfordpython.com/row-of-puzzles/abcdefgh.json</code>, but you know what I mean).</p>
