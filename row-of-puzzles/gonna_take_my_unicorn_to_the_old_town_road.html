            <h2><code>mystery</code></h2>
            <p>In this task, you will interact with a function which has been compiled into a <code>.pyc</code> file.</p>

            <p>Start by downloading <code>mystery.pyc</code> at: <a href='https://stanfordpython.com/row-of-puzzles/mystery.pyc'>https://stanfordpython.com/row-of-puzzles/mystery.pyc</a>.</p>

            <p>To interact with the <code>mystery.pyc</code> file, navigate to its enclosing directory on your hard drive in your terminal. Then, open your preferred Python shell of choice, and at the prompt, type:</p>

            <pre><code>import mystery</code></pre>

            <p>This will import the functions from the <code>mystery.pyc</code> file. Specifically, you will interact with the <code>mystery</code> function. To get started, at the prompt, type:</p>

            <pre><code>mystery.mystery()</code></pre>

            <p>This should print out to you,</p>

            <pre><code>
            Welcome to the Function of Secrets! This function can
            be called with up to N arguments (where we know N, but
            it has yet to be revealed to you!)

            To obtain the kth argument to the function, call this
            function with the prior k-1 arguments. The function 
            will then print out a small puzzle, the solution 
            to which is the kth argument. Each argument will 
            only be one word!

            E.g. if the first two arguments are "Parth" and
            "CS41", then to obtain the clue to the third
            argument, you would call:

            mystery("Parth", "CS41")

            Feeling good?

            Alright, here's the first riddle!!

            Three blind men walk up to this animal, and place 
            their hands on it to discern what it is. One says,
            "Why, it's thin, like a rope!" Another says, "I
            cannot fit my arms around it - it must be a tree!"
            The third says, "It is soft, muscular, and several
            inches wide. I believe it is a snake."

            The men all felt the same animal. What animal is it?
            (Please enter the singular form of the animal, not
            a plural).
            </code></pre>

            <p>From here, see if you can deduce the first valid argument to the function! Once you've solved the puzzle, call the function with one argument, that argument being a string consisting of your answer to the above riddle. If your answer is correct, you will then be given a clue to the second valid argument for the function. Continue in this manner until the function indicates that you have solved all its puzzles - it will then direct you to a JSON link on the Python site where you can continue your quest!
