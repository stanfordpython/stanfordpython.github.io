            <h2>ASCII Art</h2>
            <p>We're going to play around a little more with ASCII art during this assignment. We've created 24 text files, formatted as <code>{i}.txt</code> where <code>i</code> ranges from <code>0</code> to <code>23</code>. The files are hosted at the URLs <a href="https://stanfordpython.com/row-of-puzzles/ascii/0.txt">https://stanfordpython.com/row-of-puzzles/ascii/0.txt</a> through <a href="https://stanfordpython.com/row-of-puzzles/ascii/23.txt">https://stanfordpython.com/row-of-puzzles/ascii/23.txt</a>.</p>
            <p>Each of the files is formatted in the following way:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
char, num
char, num
char, num
...
                </code>
            </pre>
            For example, <code>1.txt</code> looks like:
            <pre>
                <code>
 , 44
:, 4
 , 26
:, 4
 , 1
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Each of these files represents a <i>row</i> in a multiline string. To convert the file to a row, you have to generate <code>num</code> many copies of <code>char</code>, for each of the rows in the text file, and then combine each of those strings, in order. For example, <code>1.txt</code> represents the string that is 44 spaces, followed by 4 colons, followed by 26 spaces, followed by 4 colons, followed by a space.</p>
            <p>Then, the string that will reveal the solution to this problem can be found by printing each of the rows, one after another.</p>
