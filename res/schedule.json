Together with a review of lists from last week, we'll see dictionaries, tuples, and sets, along with all of their common operators and even a few uncommon ones. We briefly look at a few looping techniques (enumerate, zip), and then dive into comprehensions. Python allows us to write list, dictionary, and set comprehensions, and we'll explore these tools as well as their connection to higher-level reasoning about problem-solving."

Lastly, we peek into an odd quirk of Python - that functions are indeed objects, and can be treated as such."

We first discuss functional programming's place in the landscape of programming paradigms - what makes this different from Java and C++ - and then introduce the concept of higher-order functions through map and filter, and anonymous lambda functions. We'll understand iterators, generator expressions, and generators as core ideas in functional programming, and briefly talk about where these tools could show up in Python. Lastly, we'll go over decorators - an amazing application of functional programming ideas to solve common programming problems."

Closure semantics are also reviewed as a preview for the main event - writing decorators!"
